# Road_Pothole_Detection_And_Reporting_System
 This project aims to develop an automated pothole detection system using a motorcycle (Honda SP 125) as the monitoring vehicle. The system uses accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to detect road irregularities and identify potholes, providing data for road maintenance and driver safety.
